- title: Free Saju Reading: A 5-Minute Beginner Start Guide
- meta: New to free saju reading? Learn input basics and first-result reading in 5 minutes.
- body: Start simple. Enter birth date, gender, and birth time if known. If time is unknown, still begin. Focus on element balance, core trait summary, and one practical takeaway. Saju works best as a self-reflection tool, not a fixed answer sheet.

## 02
- slug: saju-series-02-what-is-saju
- title: What Is Saju? Easy Guide to Four Pillars Basics
- meta: Understand saju, chart structure, and key terms in one beginner-friendly guide.
- body: Saju reads life patterns from birth year, month, day, and hour. A chart is the structured output, and calendar logic powers the calculation. You do not need to memorize all terms first. Learn reading order first, then grow your vocabulary naturally.

## 03
- slug: saju-series-03-how-to-enter-birth-info
- title: How to Enter Birth Info Correctly for Saju Reading
- meta: Learn how lunar/solar date, leap month, birth time, and timezone affect your result.
- body: Input quality changes interpretation quality. Check solar vs lunar date, leap month status, birth time, and timezone. If birth time is missing, start without it and refine later. Consistent input discipline matters more than perfection on day one.

## 04
- slug: saju-series-04-five-elements-basic
- title: Five Elements in Saju: Beginner Guide to Balance
- meta: Learn how to read wood, fire, earth, metal, and water balance in practical ways.

- title: Ilgan and Ilju Explained: Read Your Core Saju Traits
- meta: Understand ilgan and ilju and how beginners should use them with context.
- body: Ilgan points to core self-energy, while ilju shows expression patterns. They are useful starting anchors, but never final labels. Read them together with elements and life context. Good interpretation explains tendencies, not destiny.

## 06
- slug: saju-series-06-month-branch-season
- title: Month Branch and Seasonality: Why Saju Readings Differ
- meta: See why similar charts can be interpreted differently with seasonal context.

- title: 3 Things Beginners Should Read First in Saju
- meta: Start with personality, relationships, and work/money for practical interpretation.

## 08
- slug: saju-series-08-compatibility-basic
- title: Saju Compatibility Basics: Beyond Simple Match/Conflict
- meta: Learn a realistic beginner framework for compatibility beyond simple labels.
- body: Compatibility is not a pass/fail verdict. Harmony and conflict markers are directional hints. Real outcomes depend on communication, boundaries, and adjustment habits. Use compatibility reading to reduce friction, not to judge people.

- title: Daewoon and Sewoon: Beginner Timing Guide in Saju

- title: How to Use Saju in Real Life Without Blind Belief
- meta: Practical checklist to use saju in everyday decisions with balance.
