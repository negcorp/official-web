# App Hub Lite Home Update

Date: 2026-02-13

## Objective

Simplify the website for app-store-first launch while keeping the free saju preview feature available on web.

## Applied Changes

1. Home structure simplified
- Removed hero/feature/tech sections from the main flow.
- Added a lightweight app hub block with:
  - temporary app icon
  - temporary App Store / Google Play buttons
  - direct CTA to free saju preview

2. Header simplified
- Reduced to language switch + free saju preview CTA.
- Removed broader navigation links.

3. Footer simplified
- Kept only:
  - Free Saju Preview
  - Privacy Policy
  - Terms of Service

4. Dictionary updates
- Added `appHub` copy and temporary store URLs for ko/en.

## Notes

- Store links are placeholders until final app listing URLs are confirmed.
- Free Saju Preview route remains active:
  - `/ko/saju-preview`
  - `/en/saju-preview`
